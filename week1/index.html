My name is Logan Cowley and I'm studying computer science at BYU-Idaho! I have an awesome family with 2 sisters and 1 brother. I was born in California and have lived there all my life. I had served a mission in Florida Fort Lauderdale and served with the Haitian people. I am super excited to learn more of html and css this semester!
